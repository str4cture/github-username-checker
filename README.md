# github-username-checker
this reads a file and makes a new file of the available usernames

this one is pretty straightforward, just run it. the only thing that won't work with it is that characters that aren't in the english
language will just be ignored, in my example if you run it, it will say that those usernames are available when they're not. another thing
is profanities, just because github doesn't allow it.
